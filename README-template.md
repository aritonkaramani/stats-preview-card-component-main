## My process
- Started with adding a card section
- I split the card section by adding 2 smaller sections
- Fitted the sections in and started working on the colors
- After colors fixed fonts & image
- Finished with adding overlay on img
- Worked on mobile version with the use of media querys.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

One thing I learned is how to embedd pictures in the separate sheet of css. Apart from that I got better at using flex and understanding how the different parts of the css / html works together.

### Continued development

I would like to get a better workflow, as I felt like I often got stuck on one tiny little detail and spent a lot of time on it. Rather get the whole picture in than just one small little detail.

### Useful resources

- Stackoverflow. A lot of small details was found there.
